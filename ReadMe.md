# Memory Simulator

Memory Simulator is a Python-based simulation tool that emulates memory allocation for processes using three policies: Variable-Sized Partitioning (VSP), Paging (PAG), and Segmentation (SEG). It reads process data from a workload file, simulates process arrivals and completions over time, manages memory based on the selected strategy and fit algorithm (first-fit, best-fit, worst-fit), and prints real-time memory maps. The simulator tracks and displays process turnaround times, supporting redirection of output for detailed analysis.
